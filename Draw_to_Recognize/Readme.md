# Digit Classification
This Project not only trains on the mnist dataset and returns an accuracy score. But it also allows the user to draw a digit and then predicts it with a mentioned accuracy. 
## Requirements 
The Draw window uses some inbuilt features available in windows only. Hence it imports win32gui. For mac users the corresponding library would be appscript. Some changes might have to be done for the UI/UX part in mac, rest assured it works perfectly fine.
