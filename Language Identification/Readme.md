## Introduction
Ever wondered how search engines determine the diffrences in languages of the wen content when all it is to them is a bunch of 1's and 0's. This cool project uses Natural Language Processing and builds on a Language Detection Model. Not only does the language model provide good accuracy on testing dataset but can also be used tohave a hands on prediction. Explore the notebook to know more.
